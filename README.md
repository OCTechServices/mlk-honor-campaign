# MLK Honor Campaign

A civic correspondence platform honoring the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

Users purchase a message delivery service.
User payments are NOT donations.

The platform operator commits to a separate, disclosed charitable contribution.

MVP:
- Digital-only delivery
- One senator per message
- Black & white trust-first design

This is a civic integrity product.
